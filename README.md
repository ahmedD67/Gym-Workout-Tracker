# Gym-Workout-Tracker
This is the final project that I created for my C# assignment in the first course Programming in C# DA204E at Malm√∂ University.
## Program Structure
The program is a Windows Form app that allows users to enter relevant details of their workout. This includes:
- Workout Name
- Workout Type (Chest, Legs, Arms, etc..)
- Workout Notes
- Workout Exercises

The workout exercises are actually added on a separate form where the users enter the exercise name, sets, and reps. The users are able to Add, Edit, and Delete exercises during the workout. Once users are done, they can save their workout. All the workouts are stored in a listbox which can be accessed at future times. The user is also capable of saving all their workouts which get stored in a text file that can be opened up at any time through the program.
